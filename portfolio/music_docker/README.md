# Integrated Music Systems

**Project Introduction**: The project aims to analyze the most popular songs from Spotify and learn the listeners music preferences and mental health conditions. To achieve this, we will collect datasets from three diverse sources and integrate them into a relational database. The datasets include songs playlist data from Spotify API, which provides 950 songs from the “Top Hits of the 2010s” playlist. The music artist data is sourced from Kaggle and contains 1.4 million musical artists. Additionally, music and mental health survey results data from Kaggle provides information on music taste and mental health responses of the listeners.

*Project Documentation.pdf* file contains all the instructions to build the docker container, data pipeline, and project information.

Dependencies: You must download **Docker Desktop** to your computer before building the docker container to run the data pipeline and set up the DAG for the workflow automation. Once you build the container, it will have all the libraries installed to successfully execute the automation and API.
