## Sleep Disorder Prediction
Project description: Developed machine learning prediction pipelines using supervised learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), and Random Forest classifiers—with GridSearchCV for optimized hyperparameter tuning. Evaluated model performance across multiple train/validation/test splits, using various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to select the best-performing model. Analyzed the Kaggle's Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset for key patterns and ensured robust generalization through cross-validation.
