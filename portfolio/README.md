This contains independent projects completed during and after completion of a Masters of Science in Data Science at Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering.

## [Rice Classification Using CNN with PyTorch and LIME](https://github.com/mikaseel/projects/blob/main/portfolio/RiceCNNPyTorchLIME.ipynb)
Project description: Convolutional Neutral Network (CNN) was created using PyTorch to classify five different varieties of rice. The project focused on achieving high accuracy and providing interpretability for the model's predictions by using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to visualize and explain the model’s decision-making process.

## [Integrated Music Systems](https://github.com/mikaseel/projects/tree/main/portfolio/music_docker)
Project description: Built a comprehensive data pipeline that integrated data from three different sources—Spotify API and 2 from Kaggle datasets—using Python and SQL to process and upload the collected data into a PostgreSQL database. The entire pipeline was containerized using Docker to ensure portability, scalability, and ease of deployment. A web API was developed to automate workflows using Apache Airflow to enable efficient data retrieval, manipulation, updates, and pipeline management.

## [Sleep Disorder Prediction](https://github.com/mikaseel/projects/blob/main/portfolio/Sleep%20Disorder%20Prediction.ipynb)
Project description: Developed machine learning prediction pipelines using supervised learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), and Random Forest classifiers—with GridSearchCV for optimized hyperparameter tuning. Evaluated model performance across multiple train/validation/test splits, using various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to select the best-performing model. Analyzed the Kaggle's Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset for key patterns and ensured robust generalization through cross-validation.

## [Modeling Fuel Efficiency: A Comparative Analysis of Distributional and Linear Regression Approaches on the Auto-MPG Dataset](https://github.com/mikaseel/projects/blob/main/portfolio/ModelingFuelEfficiency.ipynb)
Project description: Explored the Auto-MPG dataset to model and predict fuel efficiency (mpg) of various automobiles using two key approaches: a Gaussian distributional model and a linear regression model. The analysis follows a structured workflow, including ETL, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data transformations to enhance model performance and interpretability. The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing fuel efficiency and highlights the strengths and limitations of different modeling techniques.
