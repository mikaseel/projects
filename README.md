👋 Hi, I’m Leesa Park.

💼 I’m an aspiring data scientist passionate about leveraging advanced data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to drive improvements in business processes and product experiences. I believe in the power of data-driven insights to solve complex challenges and make impactful decisions.

🌱 I’m interested in exploring data science roles, especially in industries where innovation and creativity drive key decisions. Currently, I'm focused on projects involving predictive modeling, A/B testing, and building intuitive data visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source data science projects, particularly those related to improving user experiences or building robust analytics workflows.

📫 How to reach me: Messsage me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leesapark/).

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not immersed in data, you can find me snowboarding, paddleboarding, biking, practicing yoga, and exploring all things crytals!
